Ans: It is a Tiny version of OS .The initial RAM disk (initrd) is an initial root file        system that is mounted prior to when the real root file system is available.         The initrd is bound to the kernel and loaded as part of the kernel boot        procedure. The initrd contains various executables and drivers that permit        the real root file system to be mounted, after which the initrd RAM disk is        unmounted and its memory freed.

(112) what is the difference between fdisk and gdisk?
Ans:  fdisk:

       gdisk:
              gdisk supports both MBR and GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning               schemes, which can support much larger disk sizes and a larger               number of partitions.

(147) What is the difference between Full, Incremental and Differential Backup?
Ans:
      Full Backup:
               A full backup is a complete backup of all data on a system, including files, folders, and system configurations. A full backup takes up more space and time compared to other types of backups.
       Incremental Backup:  
                 An incremental backup only backs up the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was a full backup or an incremental backup.Incremental backups are smaller and faster compared to full backups, but they require more time and effort to restore data in case of data loss.
        Differential Backup: 
                 A differential backup only backs up the data that has changed since the last full backup. This means that the differential backup  includes all the changes made since the last full backup, even if they were already backed up in previous differential backups. Differential backups are larger than incremental backups but smaller than full backups.
